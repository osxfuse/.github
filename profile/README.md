The macFUSE software is a successor to the open source Google MacFUSE software, which has been unmaintained since 2009.

In 2011 the Google MacFUSE code base has been forked and work continued under the name "FUSE for OS X" and later "FUSE for macOS" in the [osxfuse](https://github.com/osxfuse) GitHub organization. With Apple starting to use OS X as marketing name for macOS, the name osxfuse was chosen to differentiate the new project from the abandoned Google project. Continuing the project under its original name was not possible due to the name being highly associated with Google.

With the Google MacFUSE project being dead for more than a decade, the recent license change and the macOS name change, FUSE for macOS has been rebranded macFUSE in 2020. The [macfuse](https://github.com/macfuse) GitHub organization was created in 2021 to host future development.

TL;DR

Future macFUSE development has been moved to the [macfuse](https://github.com/macfuse) GitHub organization.
